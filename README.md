This is a code repository collecting utilities and functions for creating devices for microfabrication. It focuses on mostly micro-electroed-arrays for which automated routing is under continued development.

## Tutorial #1: Basics of Shapely and Phidl:
Two Python packages that synergize very well for creating device layouts are 
- Shapely: low-level, extremely powerful geometry library
- Phidl : high-level, CAD-oriented package with a focus on photonics, with a large number of quality-of-life functionalities and a gds-ii format exporter)

Video tutorial about the basics is linked below
